Feature: Noizr settings 
    As a user of gotloop
    I should be able to use Cucumber
    In order to run my E2E tests

    Scenario: Protractor and Cucumber Test
        Given I go to "https://angularjs.org/"
        When I add "Be Awesome" in the task field
        And I click the add button
        Then I should see my new task in the list
